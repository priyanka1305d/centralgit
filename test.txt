Instead of your GitHub password, use a Personal Access Token (PAT) for authentication.

Create a Personal Access Token:

Go to GitHub Token Settings.
Click Generate new token.
Select the scopes (permissions) you need, such as repo for full repository access.
Click Generate token, and copy the token (you won't be able to see it again).
Use the Token When Cloning/Pulling:

Replace your password with the token in the HTTPS URL
